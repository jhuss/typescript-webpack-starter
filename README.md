# typescript + webpack starter:

The approach is to quickly create a prototype with TypeScript and run it in the browser, keeping minimum dependencies

---


## Installation:

use **npm** or **yarn** to install

    yarn install

## Commands:

use **run** from **npm** or **yarn**

- compile the code and run the web server:

      yarn run serve

- compile only:

  - compile in development mode

        yarn run dev

  - compile in development mode

        yarn run prod

## Use:

The default web server port is **9000**, broser to:

        http://localhost:9000

- ### Source code:

    - All code must be in the `src` directory, and it is served in the "app" path
    - webpack serves the content of the `public` directory
